Iâ€™m acutely aware that my gender, race, sexual orientation, physical well-being and economic status afford me a position of privilege. I also strongly believe that it is my fundamental duty to utilize this privilege (1) to increase access and representation in science through active engagement in recruitment efforts and (2) to transform our communities into more welcoming, inclusive and supportive spaces in order to foster the growth and retention of underrepresented individuals. Work regarding diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in science has often been pioneered by underrepresented populations, placing even greater strain on professors and scientists from marginalized groups. Because of this, I believe that it is my duty as an ally with privilege to pull my full weight in the effort of establishing safe and welcoming communities for all.

If you would like to chat more about DEI issues in plasma science and engineering, please reach out to me directly via email. Only through the full engagement of the entire community can we achieve the systemic cultural change needed establish welcoming places for everyone.

In addition to DEI work, I strongly believe that the only way to realize fusion energy is to engage with a broad population through education and outreach. As such, a large portion of my time is dedicated to spreading information and opportunities in plasma science and engineering to students at all levels. By working together, we can develop the expert workforce needed to make fusion energy a reality.
