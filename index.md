## Short Bio

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University in 2021, and am currently an associate research scientist at Columbia University where I work on experimental and computational projects regarding plasma physics and fusion. 

My primary goals as a researcher concern the comprehensive study and optimization of plasma physics phenomena in magnetic confinement fusion reactors. While this does not directly answer the current call for astronomy and/or astrophysics programs, you will see in my research statement that the collaborative plasma physics program I plan to bring to the University of Montana will significantly bolster existing plasma studies and establish the potential for new connections with plasma astrophysics, thereby both strengthening and diversifying the department.
