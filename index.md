## Short Bio

It is a very exciting time to conduct magnetic confinement fusion research. In the next decade or two, the fusion community should have answers to all of the remaining basic physics questions needed to design and build a pilot plant. 
In the next several decades, fusion energy could begin to play a role in modern electric markets as one of the world's greatest engineering achievements. 

I work on tokamaks, which are toroidal magnetic devices that use strong magnetic fields to constrain a fusion-relevant plasma. 
To date, all tokamaks that have been built were built as science experiments designed to help us better understand and optimize the complicated plasma physics at play in this scenario. 
However, several tokamaks are currently being designed and built that will push this to the next stage by demonstrating ignition - the point at which more energy is produced by a plasma than was required to make it.
This milestone (which was also [recently achieved by laser-based fusion](https://www.llnl.gov/article/49301/shot-ages-fusion-ignition-breakthrough-hailed-one-most-impressive-scientific-feats-21st)) will herald a new era in fusion science and engineering studies, and I am very exited to play a leading role in helping it unfold!
