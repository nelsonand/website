## Short Bio

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University in 2021, and am currently an associate research scientist at Columbia University. I work on experimental and computational projects regarding plasma physics and fusion energy sciences and engineering. 

It is a very exciting time to conduct magnetic confinement fusion research. In the next decade or two, the fusion community should have answers to all of the remaining basic physics questions needed to design and build a pilot plant. In the next several decades, fusion energy could begin to play a role in modern electric markets as one of the world's greatest engineering achievements.
