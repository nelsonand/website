My primary goal as a researcher is to pursure novel and impactful studies that will advance the understanding of magnetic confinement fusion towards widespread commercial application. Along these lines, I collaborate with private companies and publically-funded user facilities across the globe on a broad array of topics ranging from detailed physics experiments to whole-device modeling to the development and implmentation of control and optimization schemes.
