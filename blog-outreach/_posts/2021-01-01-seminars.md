One of the most fulfilling aspects of my job as a research scientist is sharing my love of plasma physics with young members of our communities. I regularly host and participate in outreach events across the country, ranging from personalized seminars for undergraduate audiences to exploratory demos for elementary and middle school classes. Several of my invited lectures, such as this [introductory course on plasma waves](https://suli.pppl.gov/2023/course/), are available online. Some pictures from these events are inluded below. 

If you would like to partipate or host one of these events, please reach out to me via email!
