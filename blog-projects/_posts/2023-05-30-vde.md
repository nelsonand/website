Vertical stability is one of the central fundamental challenges for tokamak plasmas. While a toroidal plasma with a perfectly circular cross-section can be prevented from moving up or down by the inclusion of a small radial magnetic field (self-generated by the plasma current!), it is often desirable to stretch (or "elongate") tokamak plasmas by pulling on the top and bottom with additional magnetic field coils. Unfortunately, this introduces a destabilizing force, which must either be compensated for with active control algorithms or counteracted with passive conducting plates.

Getting all of this physics and control correct is vital for successful operation of tokamak plasmas. If a plasma goes vertically unstable, not only will you lose your fusion energy, but you can potentially trigger disastrous disruptions that have the requisite energy needed to severely damage large machines. As such, it is vital that we understand the physics leading to this phenomenon so that we may develop robust engineering solutions.
