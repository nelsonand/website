Though I do not yet have my own research group, I am directly involved in the mentorship of many young scientists. 
These include: 

## Graduate Students

2023 - **Jake Halpern** Assessment of magneto-hydrodynamic stability in negative triangularity on the DIII-D tokamak<br />
2021 - **Haley Wilson** Modeling of core plasma turbulence in negative triangularity tokamak scenarios<br />

## Undergraduate Students

2024 - **Kate Kroger** Assessment of edge profile variation using CAKE<br />
2024 - **Thomas Wang** Development of physics modules for the CFSPOPCON code<br />
2024 - **Aaroosh Ramadorai** Development of physics modules for the CFSPOPCON code<br />
2023 - **Sophia Guizzo** Studies of vertical stability for negative triangularity tokamak power plants<br />
    -- now a graduate student at Columbia
2023 - **Vikram Ailiani** Studies of magnetic equilibrium reconstruction techniques for tokamaks<br />
2023 - **Alexa Lachmann** Pythonic conversion of the FEEQS code for the OpenFUSION Toolkit<br />
    -- now a graduate student at Columbia
2022 - **Lucia Rondini** Assessment of bounce-orbit trajectories for negative triangularity shapes<br />

    -- now a graduate student at Princeton

## High School Students

2023 - **Sam Benson** Description of plasma radiation processes

## Other Teaching Endeavors

It takes a village to raise a fusion scientist. 
Because of this, in addition to the direct mentees listed above, I try to help as many students as possible from many different groups in their career paths. 
Some of this includes indirect individual mentoring, but I also work to improve plasma education on a broader national level, as detailed on my [outreach page]( https://www.oaknelson.com/outreach/).
