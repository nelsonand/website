Though I do not yet have my own research group, I am directly involved in the mentorship of many young scientists. 
These include: 

## Graduate Students

2023 - **Jake Halpern** Assessment of magneto-hydrodynamic stability in negative triangularity on the DIII-D tokamak<br />
2021 - **Haley Wilson** Modeling of core plasma turbulence in negative triangularity tokamak scenarios<br />

## Undergraduate Students

2023 - **Sophia Guizzo** Studies of vertical stability for negative triangularity tokamak power plants<br />
2023 - **Vikram Ailiani** Studies of magnetic equilibrium reconstruction techniques for tokamaks<br />
2023 - **Alexa Lachmann** (now a graduate student at Columbia) Pythonic conversion of the FEEQS code
for the OpenFUSION Toolkit<br />
2022 - **Lucia Rondini** Assessment of bounce-orbit trajectories for negative triangularity shapes<br />
2022 - **Daniel Burgess** (now a graduate student at Columbia) Studies of inherently non-ELMing tokamak scenarios<br />
2021 - **Samuel Freiberger** (now a graduate student at Columbia) Assessment of machine capabilities to create negative triangularity shapes on the MAST-U tokamak<br />
2021 - **Samantha O'Sullivan** (now a graduate student at Oxford) Correlations between neutral beam injection blips and ELM triggers in tokamaks<br />
2021 - **Javier Morales-Arias** (now a graduate student at Princeton) Modeling of lithium exposures to plasma discharges<br />

## High School Students

2023 - **Sam Benson** Description of plasma radiation processes

## Other Teaching Endeavors

It takes a village to raise a fusion scientist. 
Because of this, in addition to the direct mentees listed above, I try to help as many students as possible from many different groups in their career paths. 
Some of this includes indirect individual mentoring, but I also work to improve plasma education on a broader national level, as detailed on my [outreach page]( https://www.oaknelson.com/outreach/).
