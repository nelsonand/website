Though I do not yet have my own research group, I am directly involved in mentorship of many young scientists. 
These include: 

## Graduate Students

2023 - **Jake Halpern** Assessment of magneto-hydrodynamic stability in negative triangularity on the DIII-D tokamak
2021 - **Haley Wilson** Modeling of core plasma turbulence in negative triangularity tokamak scenarios

## Undergraduate Students

2023 - **Sophia Guizzo** Studies of vertical stability for negative triangularity tokamak power plants
2023 - **Vikram Ailiani** Studies of magnetic equilibrium reconstruction techniques for tokamaks
2022 - **Lucia Rondini** Assessment of bounce-orbit trajectories for negative triangularity shapes
2022 - **Daniel Burgess** (now a graduate student at Columbia) Studies of inherently non-ELMing tokamak scenarios
2021 - **Samuel Freiberger** (now a graduate student at Columbia) Assessment of machine capabilities to create negative triangularity shapes on the MAST-U tokamak

## Other Teaching Endeavors

It takes a village to raise a fusion scientist. 
Because of this, in addition to the direct mentees listed above, I try to help as many students as possible from many different groups in their career paths. 
Some of this includes indirect individual mentoring, but I also work to improve plasma education on a broader national level, as detailed on my [outreach page]( https://www.oaknelson.com/outreach/).
