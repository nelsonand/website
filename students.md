Though I do not yet have my own research group, I am directly involved in the mentorship of many young scientists. 
These include: 

## Primary research mentor for three graduate students

2026-2029 - **John Labatte** Gyrokinetic interpretation of the ELM-free edge in tokamaks<br />

## Other Teaching Endeavors

It takes a village to raise a fusion scientist. 
Because of this, in addition to the direct mentees listed above, I try to help as many students as possible from many different groups in their career paths. 
Some of this includes indirect individual mentoring, but I also work to improve plasma education on a broader national level, as detailed on my [outreach page]( https://www.oaknelson.com/outreach/).
